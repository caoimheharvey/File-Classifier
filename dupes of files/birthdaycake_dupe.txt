And you ain't afraid to show it
Put a candle on my motherfucking back baby blow it
Love the way you do when you do it like that
Show up with the stacks, raining racks on my rack
Wrap it up, wrap it up boy
While I take this bow off
Talk that talk, yeah I know I'm such a show off
Daddy make a wish
Put this cake in your face
And it's not even my birthday
Oooo, it's not even her birthday
But I wanna lick the icing off
Give it to her it in the worst way
Can't wait to blow her candles out
I know you wanna bite this
It's so enticing
Nothing else like this

Cake, cake, cake
