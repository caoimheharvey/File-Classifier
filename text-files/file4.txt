The Dublin region is the economic centre of Ireland, and was at the forefront of the country's economic expansion during the Celtic Tiger period. In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth richest city in the world by purchasing power and 10th richest by personal income.[59][60] According to Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, Dublin is the 13th most expensive city in the European Union (down from 10th in 2010) and the 58th most expensive place to live in the world (down from 42nd in 2010).[61] As of 2005, approximately 800,000 people were employed in the Greater Dublin Area, of whom around 600,000 were employed in the services sector and 200,000 in the industrial sector.[62][needs update]

A number of Dublin's traditional industries, such as food processing, textile manufacturing, brewing, and distilling have gradually declined, although Guinness has been brewed at the St. James's Gate Brewery since 1759. Economic improvements in the 1990s attracted a number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies to the city and Greater Dublin Area. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, Accenture and Pfizer now have European headquarters and/or operational bases in the city, with several located in enterprise clusters like the Digital Hub and Silicon Docks.

One thing I hate about Dublin… is that most public transport goes through the city centre, meaning that if you want to move from one neighbourhood to another you might have to take two buses over the course of an hour, while it’s just a ten-minute journey by car. Also Temple Bar on a weekend night, especially in the summer, is far too crowded and expensive.

The thing I love most about Dublin... is the people. We’re always up for a laugh and though we may not live in the prettiest city, we probably have the most fun. Work and wallet be damned, you’ll always find someone to go for a pint with you on a workday evening. When you combine relentless optimism with dark cynicism, it makes for some interesting results. Don’t be shy: strike up a conversation.
