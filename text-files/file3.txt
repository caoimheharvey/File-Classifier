One thing I hate about Dublin… is that most public transport goes through the city centre, meaning that if you want to move from one 
neighbourhood to another you might have to take two buses over the course of an hour, while it’s just a ten-minute journey by car. 
Also Temple Bar on a weekend night, especially in the summer, is far too crowded and expensive.
The thing I love most about Dublin... is the people. We’re always up for a laugh and though we may not live in the prettiest city, we probably have the most fun. Work and wallet be damned, you’ll always find someone to go for a pint with you on a workday evening. When you combine relentless optimism with dark cynicism, it makes for some interesting results. Don’t be shy: strike up a conversation.
