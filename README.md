Final Year Project

Note: As this project is developed for mac, the prototype will only successfully run on a mac. 

To successfully run all modules in the prototype for the interim submission follow these steps:
1. To run the facial recognition module, in terminal, execute runCV.sh and pass as an argument the name of the image you wish the program to run. 
	1.1 This will only work if the environment you are running the code on has installed opencv. This library can be installed though homebrew. 

2. The file walkthrough.py is used to run the duplication finder, primarily for images for the time being. Simply run the file. 

3. To find duplicates of the same tag value, this is achieved in getFilesByTag.py, it takes no parameters. 


If there are any issues in running the code feel free to contact me.
